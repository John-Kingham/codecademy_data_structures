# Codecademy - Computer Science Career Path - Data Structures
Here I'm bringing together all of the different data structure classes I've created in previous lessons and projects, because later projects rely on classes from earlier projects, so having them all in separate repositories doesn't make sense (or at least it makes my life harder as a Python novice).

So far, the lessons have covered:
- Stacks
- Queues
- Singly linked lists
- Doubly linked lists
- Hashmaps
